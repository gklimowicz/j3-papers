To:	  X3J3 and WG5
From:	  Jerry Wagener
Subject:  JLW informal report on X3J3 meeting 128, Palmdale, CA, 94 Feb 7-11
Date:	  14 February 94

The objectives of this meeting were to progress the work on the WG5 B9
requirements and to continue processing interpretations. In the course of the
meeting the editorial processes for Fortran 95 were fleshed out a bit and
clarified.

The 007 document is the current draft of F95; an updated version of this
document will be placed on the X3J3 server after every X3J3 meeting (the current
version on the server is F90 as modified by WG5 Technical Corrigenda 1). Each
version of the 007 will be prepared by the editorial committee from the previous
version and the OapprovedO items in documents 006, 008, 009. The 006 contains
corrigenda, the 008 contains material of an editorial (nontechnical) nature, and
all noncorrigenda actions for F95 of a technical nature are placed in the 009;
paper 94-101 contains guidelines for preparing 009 items.

A1 - corrigenda and edits:
