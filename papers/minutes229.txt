      \GENERIC  Clune: Damian, Kate,
      \JOR      Rich: Lorri, Steve, Gary
      \EDIT     Malcolm:
         Malcolm noted that there are two other versions of 23-007 in the
         edit folder, in reaction to ISO comments said document should be
         in a different font, which also requires changing the tool chain
         23-007XC replaces the main fonts with Cambria.  
         23-007XC11 is 11-point font.  
         Please take a quick peek thru the doc to give an opinion.
