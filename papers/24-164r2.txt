Introduction:
-------------

This is the 4th of 5 papers that provide edits for the approved
syntax for templates.

Straw vote: The INSTANTIATE and REQUIRE statements do not need "[::]"
            at this time, but we note that various other bits of the
            BNF also have unnecesary optional "[::]". E.g., various
            attribute specification statements: DIMENSION, INTENT,
            SAVE, ...

            Should "::" be removed from the BNF for the INSTANTIATE
            and REQUIRE statements?

            YES - omit the optional "[::]" in the BNF
            NO  - keep the optional "[::]" in the BNF
            ABSTAIN

20.6 Instantiation

20.6.1 The INSTANTIATE statement

An INSTANTIATE statement is a specification statement that identifies
an instance of a template by specifying instantiation arguments that
become associated with the deferred arguments of the named template.

R2024 <template-instantiate-stmt>
         <<is>> INSTANTIATE [::] <template-name> (
                [ <instantiation-arg-spec-list> ] ) [, <rename-list> ]
         <<or>> INSTANTIATE [::] <template-name> (
                [ <instantiation-arg-spec-list> ] ), ONLY : [ <only-list> ]

C2036 (R2024). <template-name> shall not be the name of a standalone
               template procedure.

R2025 <standalone-instantiate-stmt> <<is>>
          INSTANTIATE [::] <template-name> (
          [ <instantiation-arg-spec-list> ] ), [ONLY :] <local-name> => *

C2037 (R2025). <template-name> shall be the name of a standalone
               template procedure.

R2026 <instantiate-stmt> <<is>> <template-instantiate-stmt>
                         <<or>> <standalone-instantiate-stmt>

C2038 (R2026). Within an <instantiate-stmt>, <instantiation-arg> shall
               not depend on any entity defined within the referenced
               template.

C2039 (R2026). In <instantiate-stmt>, <template-name> shall not be the
               name of any construct in which it appears.

The INSTANTIATE statement without the ONLY option provides access to
all public entities of the referenced template.  The INSTANTIATE
statement with the ONLY option provides access only to those entities
that appear as <generic-specs>, <use-names>, or
<use-defined-operators> in the only list.

An accessible entity of the referenced instantiation is associated
with one or more accessed entities, each with its own identifier.
These identifiers are

   - the identifier of the entity in the referenced template if that
     identifier appears as an <only-use-name> or as the
     <defined-operator> of a <generic-spec> in any <only> for that
     instantiation,
   - each of the <local-names> or <local-defined-operators> that the
     entity is given in any <rename> for that instantiation, and

   - the identifier of the entity in that referenced template if
     that identifier does not appear as a <use-name> or
     <use-defined-operator> in any <rename> for that instantiation.



20.6.2 Inline instantiation of standalone template procedures

A standalone template procedure can be instantiated and referenced in
an expression or the <procedure-designator> in a <call-stmt>.

R2027 <inline-instantiate> <<is>>
    <template-name> ^ ( <instantiation-arg-spec-list> )

C2040 (R2027). <template-name> shall be the name of a
               <standalone-template-function-subprogram> or a
               <standalone-template-subroutine-subprogram>

C2041 (R2027). In <inline-instantiate>, <template-name> shall not be the
               name of any construct in which it appears.

Note: Currently standalone template procedures cannot reference
      themselves.  Future work could relax this.

The procedure designated by <inline-instantiate> is the procedure
produced from instantiating the standalone template procedure.



20.6.3 Interpretation of template instantiation

Multiple instantiations of a given template with the same actual
instantiation arguments identify the same instance of the referenced
template.

Note: As a consequence, if a template defines a derived type, two
      identical instantiations of that template define the same type.
      This provides a mechanism for derived types from templates to be
      compatible across scoping units in a convenient manner. For
      example:

   TEMPLATE TMPL(T)
      TYPE, DEFERRED :: T
      TYPE :: list_t
         TYPE(T), ALLOCATABLE :: elements(:)
      END TYPE
   END TEMPLATE

   ...

   SUBROUTINE SUB(list)
      INSTANTIATE TMPL(integer)
      TYPE(list_t) :: list
   END SUBROUTINE

   SUBROUTINE DRIVER()
      INSTANTIATE TMPL(integer)
      TYPE(list_t) :: list ! list_t is same type as in SUB
      CALL SUB(list)
   END SUBROUTINE

Two corresponding constant instantiation arguments are the same if and
only if both have the same shape, same type, same type parameters, and
are equal.

Two corresponding type-spec instantiation arguments are the same if
and only if both have the same type and have the same kind and length
type parameters.

Two corresponding procedure instantiation arguments are the same if
and only if both resolve to the same specific procedure.

Note: Example showing how procedure instantiation arguments influence
      whether instantiations are the same.

        INTERFACE
           SUBROUTINE F1(x)
              TYPE(MY_T) :: x
           END SUBROUTINE
           SUBROUTINE F2(x)
              TYPE(MY_U) :: x
           END SUBROUTINE
           SUBROUTINE F3(x)
              TYPE(MY_U) :: x
           END SUBROUTINE
        END INTERFACE

        GENERIC :: A => F1, F2
        GENERIC :: B => F1, F3

        TEMPLATE TMPL(T, F)
            TYPE, DEFERRED :: T
            INTERFACE
               SUBROUTINE F(x)
                  TYPE(T), INTENT(INOUT) :: x
               END SUBROUTINE F
            END INTERFACE
        END TEMPLATE

        INSTANTIATE TMPL(MY_T, A) ! Resolves to F1
        INSTANTIATE TMPL(MY_T, B) ! Resolves to F1 ==> same

        INSTANTIATE TMPL(MY_U, A) ! Resolves to F2
        INSTANTIATE TMPL(MY_U, B) ! Resolves to F3 ==> different


20.6.4 Deferred argument association

20.6.4.1 Instantiation arguments

Instantiation arguments are specified by an INSTANTIATE statement, a
REQUIRE statement, or by inline instantiation.

R2028 <instantiation-arg-spec> <<is>>
          [ <keyword> = ] <instantiation-arg>

C2042 (R2028). Each <keyword> shall be the name of a <deferred-arg> in
               the referenced requirement or template.

In the absence of an argument keyword, an instantiation argument
corresponds to the deferred argument occupying the corresponding
position in <deferred-arg-list>; that is, the first instantiation
argument corresponds to the first deferred argument in the
reduced list, the second instantiation argument corresponds to the
second deferred argument in the reduced list, etc.

R2029 <instantiation-arg> <<is>> <constant-expr>
                          <<or>> <type-spec>
                          <<or>> <generic-spec>
                          <<or>> <procedure-name>

Note: <generic-spec> includes operators, defined assignment and
      defined I/O.  The last may be somewhat awkward to use within a
      template without re-expressing as defined I/O again.


20.6.4.2 Deferred type association

C2043 (R2029). An <instantiation-arg> that is a <type-spec> shall
               correspond to a <deferred-arg> that is a <deferred-type>
               in the referenced template or requirement.

C2044 (R2029). An <instantiation-arg> that is a <type-spec> shall have
               constant type parameters.

C2045 (R2029). An <instantiation-arg> that corresponds to a deferred type
               that does not have the ABSTRACT attribute shall not be
               abstract.

C2046 (R2029). An <instantiation-arg>, T, that corresponds to a deferred
               type shall be a type for which a variable whose declared
               type is T is permitted in a variable definition context.

Note: This constraint ensures that intrinsic assignment of variables
      of deferred type is permitted within a template.  However, this
      also disallows some types, e.g., the EVENT_TYPE, from being used
      as an instantiation argument.

C2047 (R2029). An <instantiation-arg> that corresponds to a deferred type
               that has the EXTENSIBLE attribute shall be an extensible
               derived type.

C2048 (R2029). An <instantiation-arg> that corresponds to a deferred
               type shall not have a coarray potential subobject
               component.

Note: The above constraint avoids the possibility of assignment
      being invalid where the variable and expr do not agree on
      the allocation status of a coarray component.

Note: Non-abstract, extensible derived types can be associated with
      both abstract and non-extensible deferred type arguments.

Note: Intrinsic types, SEQUENCE types, and types with the BIND attribute
      cannot be associated with deferred type arguments that have the
      EXTENSIBLE attribute.

      Simple example illustrating the above.

      TYPE :: MY_T1
      END TYPE

      TYPE, ABSTRACT :: MY_T2
      END TYPE

      TEMPLATE TMPL1(T)
         TYPE, DEFERRED :: T
      END TEMPLATE TMPL

      TEMPLATE TMPL2(U)
         TYPE, ABSTRACT, DEFERRED :: U
      END TEMPLATE TMPL

      INSTANTIATE TMPL1(INTEGER) ! ok
      INSTANTIATE TMPL1(MY_T1)   ! ok
      INSTANTIATE TMPL1(MY_T2)   ! invalid

      INSTANTIATE TMPL2(INTEGER) ! invalid
      INSTANTIATE TMPL2(MY_T1)   ! ok
      INSTANTIATE TMPL2(MY_T2)   ! ok

Note: Potentially allow INSTANTIATE statement for an standalone
      template procedure in a generic interface block.


##.6.4.3 Deferred constant association

C2049 (R2029). <constant-expr> shall be type INTEGER, LOGICAL or
               CHARACTER.

C2050 (R2029). An <instantiation-arg> that is a <constant-expr> shall
               correspond to a <deferred-arg> that is a <deferred-const>
               in the referenced template or requirement.

C2051 (R2029). The type and kind of an <instantiation-arg> that is a
               <constant-expr> shall have the same type and kind as the
               corresponding <deferred-const> in the referenced template
               or requirement.

C2052 (R2029). If the shape of the corresponding <deferred-const> in the
               referenced template or requirement is not implied, then
               <constant-expr> shall have the same shape.

C2053 (R2029). If the rank of the corresponding <deferred-const> in the
               referenced template or requirement is not implied, then
               <constant-expr> shall have the same rank.


##.6.4.4 Deferred procedure association

C2054 (R2029). An <instantiation-arg> that is a <generic-spec> or
               <procedure-name> shall correspond to a <deferred-arg> that
               is a deferred procedure in the referenced template or
               requirement.

C2055 (R2029). An <instantiation-arg> that is a <procedure-name> shall
               have the same characteristics as the corresponding
               deferred procedure in the referenced template or
               requirement, except that a pure instantiation argument may
               be associated with a deferred argument that is not pure, a
               simple instantiation argument may be associated with a
               deferred argument that is not simple, and an elemental
               instantiation argument may be associated with a deferred
               procedure that is not elemental.

C2056. An <instantiation-arg> that is a <generic-spec> shall have
       one specific procedure that has the same characteristics
       as the corresponding deferred procedure the referenced
       template or requirement, except that a pure instantiation
       argument may be associated with a deferred argument that
       is not pure, a simple instantiation argument may be
       associated with a deferred argument that is not simple,
       and an elemental instantiation argument may be associated
       with a deferred procedure that is not elemental.

The deferred procedure is associated with the specific procedure that is
consistent with the characteristics.

Note: The previous two constraints constitute what is referred to as
      "weak constraints" in other languages.
