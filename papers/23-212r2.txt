Subject: Keyword Arguments of Deferred Procedures in Templates
Date: 2023-November-09

Reference: 23-155r2

1. Introduction
===============

In the course of developing the syntax for the template feature, we
encountered a couple of tricky aspects to handle with respect to the
possible separation and/or duplication of specifications using the
REQUIREMENT and REQUIRES feature. This paper discusses the issue with
respect to the use of keyword arguments for deferred procedures,
the possible solutions, and the rationale for the solution chosen by
the generics subgroup.

2. Deferred Procedure Dummy Argument Names
==========================================

There is a possibility for the names of the dummy arguments of a
deferred procedure to be different in the specifications in different
requirements or templates, but for all other characteristics of that
procedure to be the same. It is desirable for that to be valid, but
poses an interesting problem if one would like to use keyword arguments.
As an example, consider a situation where a template author would like
to make use of two requirements written by different authors.

REQUIREMENT R1(T, F, C, ...)
  TYPE, DEFERRED :: T
  LOGICAL, CONSTANT :: C
  INTERFACE
    FUNCTION F(A)
      TYPE(T), INTENT(IN) :: A
      TYPE(T) :: F
    END FUNCTION
  END INTERFACE
  ...
END REQUIREMENT

REQUIREMENT R2(T, G, D, ...)
  TYPE, DEFERRED :: T
  INTEGER, CONSTANT :: D
  INTERFACE
    FUNCTION G(B)
      TYPE(T), INTENT(IN) :: B
      TYPE(T) :: G
    END FUNCTION
  END INTERFACE
  ...
END REQUIREMENT

TEMPLATE TMPL(T, F, C, D, ...)
  REQUIRES R1(T, F, C, ...)
  REQUIRES R2(T, F, D, ...)
  ...
END TEMPLATE

If the characteristics of F are the same between R1 and R2, but the
names of its arguments are different it would seem as though this should
be acceptable for the same reason that the names of the arguments are not
required to match between actual and dummy for procedure arguments to
procedures.

Subgroup discussed a few different options to address this problem.

1. The names of the dummy arguments must agree in all specifications
   of a deferred procedure
2. Keyword arguments are not allowed for deferred procedures
3. Keyword arguments are only allowed for deferred procedures if the
   names of the dummy arguments are the same in all of its
   specifications
4. The names of the dummy arguments of a deferred procedure are not
   defined through its appearance in a REQUIRES statement

Subgroup decided option 1 was likely to result in frequent conflicts
between library authors, and would be untenable for a growing open-source
ecosystem. Option 2 was deemed too restrictive, as it would prevent some
use cases; namely the possibility of effective use of deferred procedures
with multiple optional arguments. Subgroup decided to go with option 4,
as it does provide a means for using keyword arguments and is backwards
compatible with a relaxation to option 3. The consequence is that in
order to use keyword arguments, an interface for a deferred procedure
must appear in the template for which it is a deferred argument. Thus
the above example would be valid, but in order to reference F with
keyword arguments within TMPL, one would need to make the following
modification.

TEMPLATE TMPL(T, F, ...)
  REQUIRES R1(T, F, ...)
  REQUIRES R2(T, F, ...)
  INTERFACE
    FUNCTION F(C)
      TYPE(T), INTENT(IN) :: C
      TYPE(T) :: F
    END FUNCTION
  END INTERFACE
  ...
    FOO = F(C=BAR)
END TEMPLATE

STRAW VOTE:

How shall the names of dummy arguments in referenced REQUIREMENTs
apply to the use of procedures within a template?

1. It is acceptable for a procedure to have different names for its dummy
   arguments in separate named REQUIREMENTs, but the procedure cannot then
   be referenced with keyword arguments unless an interface for that
   procedure is present in the template. The names of a procedure's
   dummy arguments are considered processor dependent if there is a
   conflict.
2. It is not valid for a procedure to have different names for its
   dummy arguments in separate named REQUIREMENTs unless an interface
   for that procedure is also present in the scope in which those
   REQUIREMENTs are referenced. Procedures must always have an unambiguous
   definition for the names of their dummy arguments.

  Option 1: 13
  Option 2: 6
  Undecided: 4
