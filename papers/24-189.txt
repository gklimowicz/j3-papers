1. Introduction

This paper contains an editorial improvement to the algorithm description
in CO_REDUCE. There is no change to the NOTE as yet, it will take time and
careful crafting to improve the NOTE.


2. Edits to 24-007

[383:9] 16.9.57 CO_REDUCE, paragraph 3 Arguments, OPERATION argument,
        After the sentence "Each iteration involves ... to the set."
        Insert new sentence
            "The choice of $x$ and $y$ is processor dependent."
{$something$ formats something in maths mode, which in this case means
 italics, the same as the other x's and y's in the paragraph.}

No change is needed in Annex A Processor Dependencies, as the entirety of
CO_REDUCE is considered to be processor dependent.
