-- Withdrawn 23-231 "Fortran FLUSH statement SYNC= specifier proposal"
   [Steidel](Menard/Lionel)


-- Discussion 23-232 "JOR: Asynchronous Tasks in Fortran" [Hammond]
     For discussion and feedback.
     Below are some of the notes from the discussion/feedback
       - Require a locality spec for everything referenced by
         host association.
       - Not opposed to term "TASK", but "ASYCNC BLOCK" might be more
         consistent
       - Very similar to ASYNC i/o which has "id=", again would be more
         consistent.
       - Variables should have ASYNC attribute, maybe even implicitly.
       - If we had INTENT specifications that would make it clearer
       - May add option to declare that all called routines are pure


-- Withdrawn 23-234 "IEEE-754 Recommended Math Functions" [Richardson]
   (Menard/Richardson)
        Withdrawn for rework
