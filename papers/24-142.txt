Subject: Undefinable dummy in asynchronous I/O
Date: 2024-June-24

The standard says [15.5.2.5]
"
If the procedure is nonelemental, the dummy argument does not have
the VALUE attribute, and the actual argument is an array section
having a vector subscript, the dummy argument is not definable
and shall not have the ASYNCHRONOUS, INTENT (OUT), INTENT (INOUT),
or VOLATILE attributes.
"

which makes the following code not conforming

"
       interface
         subroutine sub(arg)
           integer, asynchronous :: arg(3)
         end subroutine
       end interface
       integer :: i(10)
       call sub(i( (/2, 3, 4/)))
       end

"

However, even without the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute, "arg" can still
implicitly get the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute if it is used in an
Asynchronous WRITE statement that doesn't define it.

This seems a little inconsistent to me.

Question:
Should the standard
1. allow an actual argument that is an array section having a vector
subscript to associate with a dummy argument that has ASYNCHRONOUS
attribute,
2 (alternative), or restrict asynchronous I/O on such a dummy
argument?
