NUMBER: Fxx/xxx
TITLE: Coarray potential subobject components
KEYWORDS: coarray
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress
REFERENCES: 23-007r1

QUESTION:

Was it intended that "coarray potential subobject component", used 19
times in the standard, should actually mean "coarray ultimate
component"?
The definition of "potential subobject component" (3.30.3) includes
"nonpointer component" and the constraint

C753 A data component whose type has a coarray potential subobject
     component shall be a nonpointer nonallocatable scalar and
     shall not be a coarray.

disallows the code

  type inner
     real, allocatable :: c[:]
  end type inner
  type outer
     type(inner), allocatable :: in
  end type outer

ANSWER:

It was not intended that "coarray potential subobject component"
should mean "coarray ultimate component" and it was intended that
the above code should conform to the standard.

An edit is provided to correct the constraint.

EDIT:

[78:31-32] In 7.5.4.1 Component definition statement, in constraint C753
delete the word "nonallocatable", making it read

"A data component whose type has a coarray potential subobject
component shall be a nonpointer scalar and shall not be a coarray."
