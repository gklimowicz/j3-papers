The OpenMP committee is working towards finalization of TR13, which is
a comment draft for OpenMP 6.0 that will be released within the next
month or two. This comment draft will contain the final set of
features and substantive changes that we expect to be in OpenMP 6.0.

We had a recent meeting to go over final changes/additions for the
upcoming technical report. The more significant changes that have been
voted in or are being considered for a vote in the coming weeks
include:

* extended support for task dependences between non-sibling tasks with
  the transparent clause (renamed from "hull" since the last update);

* more control over mapping Fortran allocatables and pointers to
  devices, and general clarifications on how maps should work for
  allocatables; adding Fortran support for OpenMP-to-Foreign Runtime
  interoperability routines;

* two new loop transformations for index-set splitting ("split") and
  interleaved/striped execution of iterations ("stripe");

* significantly expanded set of allowable combined directives; allow
  nowait and depend clauses to be specifiedon "target data" construct;

* extend the reduction clause to reduce and then broadcast results to
  already privatized variables;

* allow affinity and depend clauses to be specified for a taskloop
  construct, using task_iteration directives;

* deprecate omp_lib.h in Fortran;

* a taskgraph construct that permits an implementation to record a
  sequence of constructs and the dependences between their generated
  tasks, so that a subsequent execution of the region can execute the
  resulting task graph more efficiently.

The final OpenMP 6.0 document will be released in November 2024. An
Examples document is also being prepared for release with OpenMP 6.0
or shortly thereafter.
