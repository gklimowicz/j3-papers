From: Malcolm Cohen
Subject: Preparatory edits for Fortran 2028 document
Date: 2024-October-28


1. Introduction

The editor is instructed to prepare 25-007 with the same technical content
as 24-007, but using the fonts and font sizes required by ISO House Style,
and with the edits below.


2. Preparatory edits to 24-007

Note to the editor: Do the textual changes first, then the font changes.
The font changes are described at the end, to facilitate this.

[title page] Change to "Fortran 2028 Working Draft".

[xii] Foreword,
      p7 change "fifth" to "sixth" and "fourth" to "fifth",
         change "2018" to "2023".
      p8 replace all but the last item by "- templates have been added;".
{NB this is the list of the main changes, so anything big goes here.
    We don't have templates in yet, but I'm sure they will be.
    Papers adding big features should add to this list as well as to the
    Introduction.}

[xiii-xiv] Introduction
           Move the contents of paragraph 2 into Annex C as described (see
           details of how to do this below),
           leaving the bullet points with their initial lines,
           but with no sentences following them.
{All technical changes must have an explanatory sentence added here, so the
 bullets are there to be added to. Any bullets that do not get an addition
 will be deleted at the CD stage.}

[33:14+9+] 4.3.1 Previous Fortran standards, Table 4.3,
           insert new table entry "ISO/IEC 1539-1:2023 & Fortran 2023".

[33:19+] Insert new subclause
   "4.3.3 Fortran 2023 compatibility
    This document is an upward compatible extension to the preceding
    Fortran International Standard, ISO/IEC 1539-1:2023 (Fortran 2023).
    A standard-conforming Fortran 2023 program remains standard-conforming
    under this document."
{Omitted "Except as identified in this subclause," because we do not have
 any incompatibilities yet. When we do, that will need to be changed.
 Similarly, omitted "that does not use any feature identified in this
 subclause as being no longer permitted".}

[33:20 onwards] The remaining compatibility subclauses will be renumbered
                automatically.

[33:21-22] 4.3.3 Fortran 2018 compatibility
           Delete "the preceding Fortran International Standard,".

[563:15] B.3.1 General [in B.3 Obsolescent features], p1,
         After "in Fortran" delete "90",
         change "were available in Fortran 90" to "are available",
         making the whole sentence read
    "The obsolescent features are those features of Fortran that were
     redundant and for which better methods are available."
{Correct misstatement - item (12) is not a Fortran 90 feature but 95, and
 made redundant in Fortran 2008 not 90. I fell into this looking for other
 dated refs that might need changing.}

[566:4-] Insert "C.1 Feature list
                 C.1.1 Features that were new in Fortran 2023",
         followed by the Fortran 2023 Introduction feature list we deleted
         above.
[566:4] Change "C.1" to "C.1.2" (Features that were new in Fortran 2018).
[566:14-34] Change "C.2 Fortran 2008 features not mentioned in its
                    Introduction"
            to "C.1.3 Features that were new in Fortran 2008"
            and merge the Fortran 2008 Introduction feature list with the
            existing contents, with the format of the F2008 feature list.
            Do not draw any distinction between "new features listed in the
            Introduction" and "...not listed in the Introduction".
            Delete the existing paragraph 2 "All but ... Corrigenda."
{Update our feature history subclauses and reformat.
 It is no longer of great interest which F2008 features were listed in the
 original Fortran 2008 Introduction.}

[throughout] {These font specs deduced from ISO's Word template.}
             Normal text is Cambria 11-point.
             NOTE text including the "NOTE" are Cambria 10-point,
             Ditto Notes in Clause 3.
             Fixed-space font in examples are Courier New 9-point.
             Tables are Cambria 10-point. So are Figures.
             NOTEs inside Tables & Table Footnotes are Cambria 9-point.
             But NOTEs inside Figures are Cambria 10-point, same as text.
             Normal footnotes...? I guess probably Cambria 10-point?
             Equations in the main text look like Cambria Math 11-point,
             but I think that is an artefact of it being a Word template.
