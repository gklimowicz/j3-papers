To: J3                                                     J3/24-185
From: John Reid
Subject: On the work items for the next standard
Date: 2024-October-29

References: WG5-N1594, WG5-N2234, 24-167

JOR recommends that J3 adopts the scale in N1594 (reproduced in 24-167)
as a way to estimate the total committee and vendor time needed for items
to be included in the next standard.

Further, JOR recommends that

1. the levels suggested in 24-167 for the items in N2234 be accepted
initially, pending further discussion, and

2. a column be added to standing document 010 to show the levels.
