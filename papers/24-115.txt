Subject: MPI Liason Report
Date: 2024-February-26

MPI 4.1 was released in November:
https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-4.1/mpi41-report.pdf

Work on a standard ABI for MPI is the primary activity
for MPI 4.2.  Jeff is leading that effort.  We are finding
many problems related to Fortran.  However, we will likely
drop mpif.h from the ABI (and delete it soon).  However,
we still have issues with buffer sentinels (which should
be optional arguments, but that isn't backwards-compatible).

WG5 is encouraged to assist this effort by responding
to questions such as "Did any ASYNCHRYONOUS implementations
change for TS 29113" (posted to the WG5 and J3 lists on
31 January 2024).
